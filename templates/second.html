            <img src="static/images/6.jpg" alt="Trauma-Informed Introduction">
            <p>The trauma-informed approach is a framework that acknowledges the widespread impact of trauma and
                emphasizes the need for sensitive, supportive interactions and environments. Websites designed with this
                approach are tailored to address the specific needs of survivors, offering a safe space that promotes
                healing and recovery.</p>
            <p>By adopting a trauma-informed approach, websites can create an environment that is responsive to the
                experiences of individuals who have faced trauma. This includes ensuring that the content is presented
                in a way that is accessible and supportive, avoiding re-traumatization, and providing clear information
                on available resources.</p>

            <h2>Key Principles of a Trauma-Informed Website</h2>
            <img src="static/images/7.jpg" alt="Key Principles">
            <p><strong>1. Safety:</strong> Ensure that the website is secure and that users feel safe while navigating
                the content. This includes protecting user data and providing a sense of privacy.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Trustworthiness:</strong> Establish trust by being transparent about the purpose of the
                website and how information will be used. Clear communication helps build a reliable relationship with
                users.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Empowerment:</strong> Offer resources and tools that empower users to make informed decisions
                about their healing process. This can include access to support services, self-help resources, and
                educational materials.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Collaboration:</strong> Work with trauma survivors and experts to ensure that the website
                meets the needs of its audience. Involving those with lived experience can provide valuable insights and
                improve the effectiveness of the website.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Recognize and respect the diverse backgrounds and experiences
                of users. Providing culturally relevant resources and being mindful of different perspectives helps
                ensure that the website is inclusive and accessible to all.</p>
